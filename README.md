âœ¨I'm an Aspiring Full Stack Developer, based in Savannah, Georgia. I currently attend WGU, pursuing a B.S. in Software Development. 

Currently studying as a Full Time student, with hopes of graduating in 2022. I am completely open for internships, so don't hesitate to reach out! When I'm not busy studying or coding, you can find me practicing my photography skills, or jamming out on the drums.
